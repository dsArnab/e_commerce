## Responsive Design

All components are fully responsive:

- **Touch-friendly**: Proper button sizes and spacing

## Testing Scenarios

2. Edit existing product details
3. Delete product with confirmation
4. Verify admin-only access

### User Testing

2. Filter by category
3. Sort by price (ascending/descending)
4. Add products to cart
5. Use "Buy Now" functionality

### Integration Testing
